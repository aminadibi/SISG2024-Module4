## [Module 4 - Health Disparities Research](https://sisg.biosciences.gatech.edu/sisg-module-4/)

Health disparities are defined as health differences that adversely affect socially disadvantaged populations.  This new module is designed to introduce the theory and practice underlying an approach to health disparities research focused on both social determinants of health and genetic risk factors. 

Theoretical background lectures will be paired with practical lab sessions, using R and various bioinformatics applications, documented and run using Jupyter Notebook, to analyze heterogenous biobank data.  Students will be provided with a conceptual foundation on how health disparities are defined, quantified, and characterized, and they will use biobank demographic and electronic health record data to quantify health outcomes and disparities.  The module will emphasize genetic ancestry inference as a means to decompose genetic and socioenvironmental contributions to health disparities, covering admixture regression techniques used to associate ancestry with health outcomes. 

### Prerequisites:

+ Students are required to bring their own laptops for computer lab sessions.

+ Quantative and statistical analyses will be conducted in R using Jupyter Notebook.

+ Please see pre-requisites folder for instructions on how to install R and Jupyter Notebooks on Windows or Mac laptops. 

### Statistical Methods:

Quantitative and statistical methods that will be covered in this module include:

+ Computational phenotyping with electronic health record data
  
+ Age- and sex-adjusted disease prevalence estimation

+ Multivariable disease modeling with linear and logistic regression

+ Genetic diversity and population structure characterization

+ Genetic ancestry inference

### Learning Objectives:

After attending this module, participants will be able to: 

+ Understand how health disparities are defined, quantified, and characterized

+ Understand the conceptual relationships and differences between race, ethnicity, and ancestry

+ Quantify health outcomes and disparities using biobank electronic health record data

+ Model the associations of social determinants of health and genetic risk factors with health outcomes and disparities

+ Infer genetic ancestry from genomic variant data

+ Model the associations of genetic ancestry with health outcomes and disparities
